File:gcd_decomposition.c
multiple thread to calculate gcd and factors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Written by = Gal Meir Malka and Yaniv Sonino
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
program that creates 3 threads:
1.gcd thread
2.decomposition thread
3.client thread
the user enters a char for action(g for gcs,d for decomposition),and than gets 
an answer from the target thread
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile: gcc -Wall gcd_decomposition.c -lpthread -o gcd_decomposition
Run:    ./gcd_decomposition
Input:   char for action ("g" for gcd, "d" for decomposition) and values
             1.(d) number for decomposition 
             2.(g) numbers for gcd
	     
	     ^c to shut down all threads
	     
Output:  The answer
